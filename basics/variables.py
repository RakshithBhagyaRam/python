'''
rules to be followed to declare a variable

1. variable names should not be a keyword (predefined word)
2. should not start witha a number
3. should not consider special characters like (:;-&+#@)  except under_score " _ "
4. keywords can be used as a variable name only if capitalise the word . because python is a case sensitive language
